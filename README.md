# KDD - Knowledge Discovery in Databases
This course is about data mining. It is an essential part of AI, which is one of the
hottest topics in computer science today. Data mining is a fast-evolving field,
especially for recent five years.

The availability of large amounts of data has created unprecedented opportunities to
leverage computational and statistical approaches to turn data into actionable
knowledge. This course covers general techniques for analyzing large amounts of
numerical and text data. The entire data mining process is covered in this course:
setting up a problem, data preprocessing, model constructions, model evaluations,
and interpretations in decision making.

This course covers both classical data mining approach (e.g., Apriori, Random
Forest, etc) as well as the recent deep learning models (e.g., RNN, CNN, BERT). In
addition, the recent rise of large language models (LLMs), especially ChatGPT, has
brought global excitement. We have LLMs as one of our topics.
